# picobello üëåüèª

*picobello* is an open-source research platform focusing on AI and Machine Learning acceleration.

*picobello* is developed as part of the [PULP (Parallel Ultra-Low Power) project](https://pulp-platform.org/), a joint effort between ETH Zurich and the University of Bologna. *picobello* is also supported by the [EUPilot project](https://eupilot.eu), under the name MLS.

## üöß Getting started (currently in early development)

### Environment setup for IIS-members

For IIS-members, the environment can be set up by sourcing the `iis-env.sh` script:

```bash
source iis-env.sh
```

This will set up all environment variables, and install the virtual python environment, which is needed to generate the RTL and SW sources.

### Environment setup for non-IIS members

For non-IIS members, there is some additional setup required to get the environment up and running.

#### Bender

The first requirement you need to install is `bender`. Check the [installation page](https://github.com/pulp-platform/bender/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) on how to set it up.

#### Virtual Python environment

You need to have a python>=3.11 installed, in order to create the virtual python environment:

```bash
make python-venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

By default, it will use the `python` in your `$PATH`. If you want to use a specific python version, you can set the `BASE_PYTHON` environment variable accordingly.

#### Toolchains

Picobello requires two different toolchains at the moment:

* Snitch software tests require the Clang compiler extended with Snitch-specific instructions. There are some precompiled releases available on the [PULP Platform LLVM Project](https://github.com/pulp-platform/llvm-project/releases/download/0.12.0/riscv32-pulp-llvm-ubuntu2004-0.12.0.tar.gz) fork that are ready to be downloaded and unzipped.
* Cheshire requires a 64-bit GCC toolchain that can be installed from the [riscv-gnu-toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain) git following the *Installation (Newlib)* instructions.

Once LLVM and GCC are obtained, export a `LLVM_BINROOT` environment variable to the binary folder of the LLVM toolchain installation. Then, add the GCC binary folder to your `$PATH`:

```bash
export LLVM_BINROOT=/path/to/llvm/bin
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/gcc/bin
```

#### Verible (Optional)

For automatic formatting of generated sources, install [`verible`](https://github.com/chipsalliance/verible). By default, the Makefile will look for a `verible-verilog-format` in your path, but you can also set it explicitly with the `VERIBLE_FMT` environment variable. This dependency is optional for normal users, but it is required to contribute to the project, since the CI will use verible to check the formatting of the code. Once installed, you can format the SV code in this repository with:

```bash
make verible-fmt
```

### RTL code generation

After setting up the environment, you can generate all the RTL code for Cheshire, FlooNoC, and Snitch by running:

```bash
make all
```

or more selectively:

```bash
make floo-hw-all
make chs-hw-all
make sn-hw-all
```

### Compile software tests

To compile the software for Cheshire and the snitch cluster, you can run the following commands:

```bash
make sw
```

or more selectively:

```bash
make chs-sw-tests
make sn-tests
```

### Platform simulation
The Picobello simulation flow currently only supports Questasim.
To build the RTL code, do:

```bash
make vsim-compile
```

Tests can be executed by setting all the required command-line variable for Cheshire, see the [Cheshire Docs](https://pulp-platform.github.io/cheshire/gs/) for more details.
To run a simple Chehire helloworld in Picobello, do the following:

```bash
make vsim-run CHS_BINARY=sw/cheshire/tests/helloworld.spm.elf
```
To run an offloading example test for Snitch, do:

```bash
make vsim-run CHS_BINARY=sw/cheshire/tests/simple_offload.spm.elf SN_BINARY=sw/snitch/tests/build/simple.elf
```

Use the `vsim-run-batch` command to run tests in batch mode with RTL optimizations to reduce the Questasim runtime.

Use the `PRELMODE=3` flag to enable fast preload of the Snitch binary, and speed up the simulation.

Some applications produce a lot of output data, which would be time-consuming to check in simulation.
Said applications usually come with a Python verification script that can check the results from a dump of the memory contents at the end of the simulation.
For example, a verification script for the GEMM kernel can be found under `$(bender path snitch_cluster)/sw/blas/gemm/scripts/verify.py`
To run an application on Snitch and verify its results, do:
```bash
make vsim-run-batch-verify VERIFY_PY=$(bender path snitch_cluster)/sw/blas/gemm/scripts/verify.py PRELMODE=3 CHS_BINARY=sw/cheshire/tests/simple_offload.spm.elf SN_BINARY=sw/snitch/apps/blas/gemm/build/gemm.elf
```

### Additional help

Additionally, you can run the following command to get a list of all available commands:

```bash
make help
```
